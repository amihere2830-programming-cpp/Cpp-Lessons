# Integer Modifiers

In C++, integer modifiers are used to specify the size and signedness of an integer variable. There are four integer modifiers in C++:

- **short**: The "short" modifier specifies that an integer variable should be stored in a short integer type, which is typically 16 bits (2 bytes) in size.
- **long**: The "long" modifier specifies that an integer variable should be stored in a long integer type, which is typically 64 bits (4 bytes)  in size.
- **long long**: The "long long" modifier specifies that an integer variable should be stored in a long long integer type, which is typically 64 bits (4 bytes)  in size.
- **unsigned**: The "unsigned" modifier specifies that an integer variable should be stored as an unsigned integer type, which means that it can only store non-negative values, which is typically 32 bits (4 bytes)  in size.

For example:
```
short int a; // short integer
long int b; // long integer
long long int c; // long long integer
unsigned int d; // unsigned integer

```


These modifiers can be used in combination with each other, such as "unsigned long long int" to specify an unsigned long long integer type.

Integer modifiers are useful for specifying the size and signedness of an integer variable to ensure that it is stored in the desired type. They are particularly useful when working with large or negative values that may not fit in a standard integer type.
